I'm Xiaonan (pronouced [Hsiao-Nan](https://www.howtopronounce.com/hsiaonan#google_vignette)), or Steve. I am a PhD candidate in economics at the [University of Rochester](http://www.sas.rochester.edu/eco/index.html).

My research focuses on macroeconomics, with a special interest in the roles of firms and workers, and their interactions within the labor market.
